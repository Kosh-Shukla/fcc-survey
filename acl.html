				Introduction
			</header>
			<p>I never thought much about the little things in life. The way my parents' smiles made me feel, or how it felt to be startled and jump. These were all things that I took for granted. But that all changed when I tore my ACL.</p>
			<p>This injury and the recovery process that followed taught me many valuable lessons about life, and I would like to share those lessons with you in this essay.

				The Importance of Appreciating the Little Things
			</header>
			<p>
    I used to be one of those people who took the little things in life for granted. I never stopped to appreciate the beauty of my parents' smiles or the feeling of a morning walk.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until I was forced to slow down and focus on my recovery that I began to see the world in a different way. I realized that it was the little things in life that made it worth living.

    Finding a Purpose in Life

			</header>
			<p>After finishing college, I found myself struggling to find a purpose in life. I had spent years preparing for a career that I ultimately didn't pursue, and I was left feeling lost and unsure of what to do next.</p>
			<p>It wasn't until I set my sights on the Civil Services Examinations that I finally found a goal to work towards. This goal gave me a sense of purpose, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I had a direction in life.

				The Boredom of Repetition
			</header>
			<p>
    As I prepared for the Civil Services Examinations, I quickly realized that I was becoming bored with the repetition of studying and taking practice exams. I found myself looking for something more engaging, something that truly fulfilled me.</p>
    <p>This experience taught me that it's important to find something that you're truly passionate about, something that makes you excited to wake up in the morning and start your day.

				Lessons
			</header>
			<p>In this Time period, I had a bit of time to reflect on my life. I have forced myself to write these lessons. But , for that I needed some problems and realisations that came out of it. So, here they are:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>I have no one except my family who cares about me. It didn't came as a shock to me as I knew I was lonely beforehand. But it left me without support even if only emotional.</li>
					<li>You can't rely on jobs that use your body mostly, so this includes jobs like mechanics, artisans,daily-wage workers,etc</li>
					<li>My body was not in the prime condition to handle the stress, physically.</li>
					<li>Feeling useless is probabaly more deadly than death itself.</li>
					<li>We go about our lives taking things for granted, but its only when they are taken from us that we realise what we lost.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p> 	I hope that by sharing my experience, I can be useful to someone, because as of now, physically , I am not.<br>
					So, what will I do about it? I don't know, but first I would identify more lessons I could take out of it. Later, I would think how I can implement them. Nevertheless, somethings I know I have to do. I have listed them below.:
					<ul>
						<li>Change my job goal even though I have none. To look into areas, where even if I loose my body to some extent, I would stil be able to earn. </li>
						<li>Invest and learn Investing so that even when I loose my body to full extent, meaning I die, my family has something to depend on.</li>
						<li>I would never put myself in situation out of ego or anything, where I loose some of my abilities of any kind, but most importantly - physically , I would never risk myself.</li>
						<li>I would slowly build back the connectins that I have lost. That way, if something happens again, I have someone to fallback on. Also, now more importantly, someone can rely on me as their support because god knows how many people are in worse conditions than me.</li>
						<li>The only thing that I will care about is my family and people around my , even if it costs me a small discomfort financially.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>So, I hope this acts as  reminder for you to reflect on your life as well.			</p>
